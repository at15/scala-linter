# Unused parameters

see `playground/param.sc`

TODO: why I got two function when I have only defined one, because of the default value? yes.
so we don't need to check this kind of function.

````
 def bark(name: Predef.String, date: Predef.String = "213"): Unit = {
    val z = 2;
    val doubi = name.$plus("is a doubi");
    Predef.println(date)
  };
  <synthetic> def bark$default$2: Predef.String = "213";
  ()
````  
PS: synthetic means fake
so the step would be like this.


1. traverse the tree to get functions.
2. filter the function that don't need check, ie: Main, function generated by compiler (like the default
 argument one.
3. match the function parameters by looping valDefs `DefDef(mods, _, _, valDefs, _, body)`
  TODO:some valDefs need to be removed? or see HairyFotr's _.filterNot(???) 
4. traverse the body of the function and see if the variables are used. 
  inorder to improve speed, we can store all the val names in a array, and every time we extract
  one used variable using `Ident(TermName(name))`, we check if the array is empty, if is, meaning
  not param or all param has been used. we don't need to traverse anymore. if the name we extract
  is in the array of names, we remove this name from the array and keep traversing until it ends.
  At last we check if that array is empty or not and warn all the left as unused.
